<p style="color:blue">What i learned from my reading of (the fundamentals of a good developer mindset)</p>

1. Most important thing of developers works is to focus on helping people.
2. A good developer is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.
3. As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of my main responsibilities.
4. WORA! Write Once Run Anywhere.
5. Understanding.
> If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. — Richard Feynman
6. Finaly, don't seek perfiction.
